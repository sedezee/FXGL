JavaFX Game Development Framework

[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.github.almasb/fxgl.svg)]()
[![Build Status](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL/workflows/Java%20CI%20with%20Maven/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL/actions)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/AlmasB/FXGL/branch/dev/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/AlmasB/FXGL)

### Why FXGL?

* No installation or setup required
* "Out of the box": Java 8-15, Win/Mac/Linux/Android 5.0+/iOS 11.0+/Web
* Simple and clean API, higher level than other engines
* Superset of JavaFX: no need to learn new UI API
* Real-world game development techniques: Entity-Component, interpolated animations, particles, and [many more](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL/wiki/Core-Features)
* Games are easily packaged into a single executable .jar or native images

### Good for:

* Any 2D genre (side-scroller / platformer / arcade / RPG)
* Complex UI controls
* Hobby / academic / commercial projects
* Teaching / learning / improving game development skills
* Fast prototyping of game ideas

### Minimal Example

```java
public class BasicGameApp extends GameApplication {

    @Override
    protected void initSettings(GameSettings settings) {
        settings.setWidth(800);
        settings.setHeight(600);
        settings.setTitle("Basic Game App");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        launch(args);
    }
}
```
